# URGENT: Fix Container Registry Deprecation Error

## The Problem
You're seeing this error:
```
Container Registry is deprecated and shutting down, please use the auto migration tool to migrate to Artifact Registry (gcloud artifacts docker upgrade migrate --projects='tuanluongworks')
```

## Quick Fix - Choose One Method

### Method 1: Google Cloud Shell (Recommended - Fastest)

1. **Open Google Cloud Shell**: https://shell.cloud.google.com
2. **Run this single command**:
   ```bash
   gcloud artifacts docker upgrade migrate --projects=tuanluongworks
   ```
3. **Wait for completion** (usually 5-15 minutes)
4. **Done!** Your builds will now work

### Method 2: Using Cloud Build

1. **Run the migration build**:
   ```bash
   gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild-migrate.yaml
   ```
2. **Wait for completion**
3. **Done!** Your builds will now work

### Method 3: Local Machine (if you have gcloud CLI)

1. **Authenticate**:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud config set project tuanluongworks
   ```
2. **Run migration**:
   ```bash
   ./migrate-gcr-to-ar.sh
   ```

## What This Does

- ✅ **Creates Artifact Registry gcr.io repositories**
- ✅ **Redirects all gcr.io traffic to Artifact Registry**  
- ✅ **Copies all your existing images**
- ✅ **No code changes needed** - same URLs continue working
- ✅ **Zero downtime** - builds continue working immediately

## After Migration

Your existing code continues working exactly as before:
- `gcr.io/tuanluongworks/trading-system` URLs still work
- Cloud Build continues using the same configuration
- No deployment changes needed

## Verification

After migration, test that it worked:
```bash
# This should work without errors
docker pull gcr.io/tuanluongworks/trading-system:latest

# Your normal build should now succeed
gcloud builds submit
```

## If You Need Help

The migration is **safe and reversible**. Google's tool handles everything automatically.

**Priority**: Run this migration ASAP to fix your builds.
